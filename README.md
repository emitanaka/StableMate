# StableMate
StableMate [(Deng et al.2023)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.26.559658v1) is a regression and variable selection framework in a multi-environment regression setting. Given a response, StableMate distinguish between stable and unstable predictors that have consistent or changing functional dependencies (e.g, fitted regression models) on the response across environments, respectively. Stable predictors entile strong causal implication and can be selected to enforce generalizability of regression models. Unstable predictors (which we refered to as environment-specific predictors in our manuscript) reveals the impact of environment pertubation on the studied system of predictors and response.

StableMate is built based on the theoretical foundation of **Stabilized Regression** [(Pfister et al. 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01850), but implements a different algorithm, **Stochastic Stepwise Variable Selection (ST2)** [(Xin et al. 2012)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10618600.2012.679223), to discern stability, since the original algorithm is slow and inacurrate when applied to large scale data. We made further modification on the ST2 algorithm to improve computational efficiency, and proposed a new statistical concept called **pseudo-predictor** that adds on intuitive and accurate benchmark of ST2 selections.

```

## Usage
More details can be found in the [pkg](./pkg) folder.
Run StableMate regression
``` r
#' @param Y A response vector or matrix depending on the objective function. It should be a vector if the function is used with
#' StableMate's default objective.
#' @param X A predictor matrix with rows representing samples and columns representing predictors. The columns must be named.
#' @param env A character vector indicates sample environments. Should be of the same length as the number of rows of \code{X}.
#' @param ncore Numerical; Numerical; If greater than 0. Parallel computing is enabled.
mod_stbm <- stablemate(Y = y, X = X, env = env, K =100, ncore = 5, verbose = F)
```
Print StableMate regression
``` r

```
Plot StableMate regression
``` r
plot(mod_stbm)
```
Predict by StableMate regression
``` r
predict(mod_stbm,  X = X)
